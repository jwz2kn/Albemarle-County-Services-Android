# Albemarle-County-Services-Android
This Android application, written in Java, is a first version application written for the Albemarle County government.
We're trying to create an all-around application that provides numerous government services through the use of a mobile device
and by directing citizens to the proper resources. This is not a final version, but a preliminary version that is released 
mostly for testing within the government. Most of the code is well-commented and self-explanatory, but the basic
organization is as such:
-Splash screen
-Main screen, with 5 buttons as options
      - A basic help form for problems
      - Road and zoning information
      - Tip-off law enforcement
      - Paperwork information (marriage certificates, divorce certificates, other documents provided by state and county, etc.)
      - Contact info for county
      
To view the most recent version of the source code, go to the App2 version.
